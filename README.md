Need an someone to print your stuff? We got you covered!

### What is Printo?
Printo is a platform offering Peer-to-Peer (P2P) printing services. In a pinch and need a document printed ASAP but all nearby printing shops are closed? We got you covered. Want to turn your printer at home into a flexible source of side income? We got you covered too. 

### Why Printo?
The idea for Printo came up when we were thinking about the challenges that us students face. We realised that most households don't have a printer at home. Us students are always rushing till the last hour to meet our assignment deadlines, usually until the wee hours when all printing shops are closed. 

Printo exists to get a document printed in the last minute pronto.
